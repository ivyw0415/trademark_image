This is a project to retrieve trademark image shape features and compare them with other trademark images to tell the similarity between images.
In this project, I used shape features such as wavelet transform result as directional information and zernike moments as global features and also some local features like curvature, distance to centroid to describe the trademark images.

The final application of combining all the features together generated very pleasant result. And you may find them in the screenshots.
